public class Notes {
    /*
two types of variables primitive and reference,
java can watch out for you and wont let you put a float into an integer variable
unless you acknowledge the compiler
variable must have a type and a name, also a variable is a container
but you cant put a large value into a small cup

a class describes what an object knows and what an object does
class is a blueprint for object

polymorphism needs interfaces and using this we can make
this inherit from certain classes

objects can be destroyed and deleted but if the object gets
abandoned the garbage collector claims it and the memory
is reclaimed
